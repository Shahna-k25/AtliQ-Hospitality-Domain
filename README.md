# AtliQ-Hospitality-Domain
Power BI Project
## Project Overview
This Power BI‚Äìdriven dashboard offers an in-depth view of hospitality performance by analyzing critical metrics such as revenue trends, occupancy rates, and booking platform effectiveness. Designed for decision-makers, it transforms raw data into clear, interactive visuals, making it easier to identify opportunities, reduce inefficiencies, and enhance profitability. By delivering real-time insights, it equips businesses to respond quickly to market changes and maintain a competitive edge in the hospitality industry.
## Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a third-party service provider to provide insights from their historical data.
